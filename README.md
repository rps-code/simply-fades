## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

-   Simply yet elegant fade in animations
-   Ultra lightweight
-   No dependancies
-   Written purely in Typescript
-   Basic and really simple to use
-   Works everywhere, anytime

## üì¶ Getting Started

### NPM

```
npm i simply-fades
```

### Yarn

```
yarn add simply-fades
```

In your project, import the SimplyFade class like so:

```js
import { SimplyFade } from 'simply-fades'
```

Usage:

> **Note**: If the element does not load, make sure you are initialising your HoverCursor after `DOMContentLoaded`!

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    new SimplyFade()
})
```

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Example

The following code produces the behaviour displayed in the GIF.

![](https://github.com/rps-code/hover-cursor/blob/main/demo.gif)

```js
import { SimplyFade } from 'simply-fade'

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    new SimplyFade()
})
```

You define directions on attributes, by default this attribute is `simply-fade`, but can be changed (read below).

```html
<div simply-fade="right">...</div>
```
